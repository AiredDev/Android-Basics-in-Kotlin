# Android Basics in Kotlin

A collection of apps I've created while following Google's developer course ["Android Basics in Kotlin".](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course)

After cloning the repo, apps can be compiled and run by importing them into [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). 

I tested these apps in two places: on my physical device, a Samsung Galaxy S20 5G; and on the Android Emulator supplied by Android Studio, specifically with the Pixel 3 XL AVD.
